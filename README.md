# Kmedoid Clustering Algorithm

Save file as filename.java

**Input:**
1. No. of nodes in a undirected Graph.
2. Adjacency matrix of the Graph.
3. No. of cluserts should be 3.
4. Enter three initial clusters.

**Output:**
1. Final clusters centers, and the clusters with respective centers.

**Advantage of Kmedoid Algorithm**
1. Medoids are representative objects of a data set or a clusters with a data set whose average dissimilarity to all the objects in the cluster is minimal.

**Disadvantages of Kmedoid Algorithm**
1. Time ccomplexity is more than Kmeans clustering Algorithm.
2. Accuracy of Kmedoid totally depends on initial clusters chosen(initial clusters must be chosen that they differ from each other greatly).

**Constrain**
This code is for 3 clusters.It could be changes further.
